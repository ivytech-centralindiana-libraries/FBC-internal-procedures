## Ordering through Midwest Library Service

1. Use the year's PO (ask Deb) for your new PO number. Do not fill in any box that says ‘Fund’. Midwest will do that when they separate the books according to the final price – below $35 or above $35.
2. Once you place your order you need to export the titles to an Excel spreadsheet and send it to Michele AND Andy so they can enter it in the MOF. They will not have access to your accounts so you will have to give them this information.
3. Save this Excel spreadsheet in the J drive under the new Midwest file. Each librarian will find a folder there for you to put your cart reports in. I need these reports to have public access so that if something needs to be processed and Michele or Andy is not available, then others can go in a do the processing for you.
4. Another change is that you will have to go into your account to find the final total prices for each cart you order. There is no way for you to know the discounted price until the invoice for your cart is loaded into your account. Once you have that you can record the final total for your cart in your CD spreadsheet page. It will be up to you to track your own spending. The invoices Dionna will receive will not break up the orders in carts. They will list everything that is sent out each week and may be a combination of carts from different librarians’ orders.
5. If you need any help or have questions call Terry or Steven at Midwest. They are very helpful and willing to do whatever is needed to help you with your orders. Midwest number is 800-325-8833. They do not have voice mail so if you get a busy signal, call back later.
