#General Information
 
##Staff Communication
 
###In Case of Illness
As soon as possible, text and email the Assistant Director, the Full-time Librarian, and the Full-time Library Assistant to let them know.

###Inclement Weather
 As part of Ivy Tech Community College's ongoing effort to keep students, faculty and staff informed, the College has implemented an urgent information messaging system. [Ivy Tech Alert](https://www.ivytech.edu/alert/) allows students, faculty and staff to receive time-sensitive messages in the form of text messages and/or emails about inclement weather campus closings and other campus emergencies (lockdowns).  Go to the link provided to sign up.
 In addition to the Ivy Tech Alert, the Assistant Director has a phone tree that is used to notify staff of school closings, etc.  You may receive a text message or phone call from the Assistant Director or the full-time Library Assistant.
 
###Schedule Changes
 Email requests for schedule changes to the Assistant Director and the full-time Library Assistant as soon as possible.  Even when you verbally ask for a schedule change, the request should be sent via email to give each of them a written record of the request.  This is done for time-off, a change in hours on a particular day, vacation, or if you wish to work extra hours to make up for previous time off.

##Google Calendar
The Lawrence Library has two calendars on the Google drive - for staff scheduling and for instruction.  The calendars can be accessed on the [calendar page of the library portal](https://sites.google.com/site/lawrencelibraryhomepage/calendars).  In order for you to view the more detailed information in the calendars, you must have a Google email account.  Each new employee gives their Google email account to the technology librarian, and they give them access to the calendars via their Google account.  

To access the staff calendar, go to Google.com, and click on the small nine-box grid in the upper right corner of the page.  Select Calendars from the drop down menu.  This will take you to the Lawrence calendars.  You can toggle back and forth from each one on the left-hand side section titled "My Calendars."  Along the top you can select to view a day, a week or a month.  

To access the information on the Bibliographic Instruction spreadsheet, which is created with the information faculty inputs from the Library Instruction Request Form (view the most recent form on the [Library Portal](https://sites.google.com/site/lawrencelibraryhomepage/library-links-1)), you must be "invited" by the technology librarian.  Each semester a new spreadsheet is created to hold the instruction information for that semester, and each semester you must be invited to view the new spreadsheet.  

To view the instruction spreadsheet, go to Google.com, and click on the small nine-box grid in the upper right corner of the page.  Select Drive from the drop down menu, then select "Shared with Me" from the menu on the left.  This will give you a list of Google docs you have been invited to view.  Select the spreadsheet you wish to see. 

##Desk Etiquette

###General Information
- Always greet students with a hello and a smile when they first walk in the library.
- If you need to say “no”, explain why in a calm and respectful manner.
- Always treat the patrons with respect.
- If you are the only one on duty at the Circulation Desk and it is very busy (more than five patrons are waiting) you may ask the office manager or librarian on duty to help you if he/she is free. 
- If you are the only one on duty at the Circulation Desk and you want to leave the work area, either for break or washroom, please let the office manager and/or librarian on duty know. 

###Problem Patrons
- If patrons are rude, disruptive, or complain about the library policy or procedure, refer them to the full-time library assistant for immediate assistance.  If the issue cannot be resolved immediately with the full-time library assistant, refer them to the assistant director with the Assistant Director's card and email for future resolution. 
- After staff gives patron with complaint the Assistant Director's card and email, then the staff members who deal with the patron will email the assistant director with the history of the problem along with patron info.
- When the Assistant Director and full-time Library Assistant are out, ask the librarian in charge to handle the situation.
- If the situation escalates to an uncomfortable level, contact Security immediately via panic button and/or phone (see below).

##Calling Security
**If you feel physically threatened, push the panic button located in the top right-hand drawer of the Circulation Desk.**

In a situation when a patron is giving you a hard time or is uncooperative, first contact the Full-time library assistant.  If he/she is not available, contact the Assistant Director.  If he/she is not available, call Security.

To call Security, 945-4302 or 921-4303.

##Incident Reports
An Incident Report is needed any time Security is contacted with a patron issue.  This helps Administration keep track of repeat offenders and also to know exactly what the person did, as that is not included in Security's report.  

The Assistant Director will submit the Report, but whoever is present when the incident occurs needs to submit information about it to the Assistant Director via email in a timely manner.  If the Assistant Director is not here, the full-time Librarian and/or Library Assistant needs to be notified instead.  

The Incident Report information also needs to be copied on the [Lawrence Issues Blog](http://lawrence-library.blogspot.com/), so that everyone on staff can access the information if need be.

The [Incident Report form](https://publicdocs.maxient.com/incidentreport.php?IvyTechCC) is located on [Campus Connect](https://cc.ivytech.edu/cp/home/displaylogin).  The form can be referred to when submitting information to the Assistant Director, so that you know what information is needed.

##Copying & Printing
Library workers may help students with copying by showing them which buttons to push, how to use the coin machine, or showing them the correct placement of items to be copies, but may not demonstrate or make copies for them.  This is due to the copyright laws and the Notice posted on the copier, which states "The Copyright Laws of the United States(Title 17,U.S. Code) Governs the Making of Photocopies or other Reproductions of Copyrighted Material.  Any Person Using this Equipment is Liable for any Infringement."
- If a student needs a print job reprinted, use the Pharos software to reprint ([see instructions here](http://library.ivytech.edu/c.php?g=416463&p=3363211)).  This will give them free reprints, so make sure they only receive reprints if there is a valid reason.
- To print double-sided, if the document is landscape, flip on the short side.  If the document is portrait, flip on the long side.
- To print labels, cardstock or with colored paper through the bypass tray of the color printer, [see instructions here](http://library.ivytech.edu/c.php?g=416463&p=3363211#s-lg-box-wrapper-13193443).
- To print the APA and MLA Citations Guides and the Annotated Bibliography examples, fill out a [Facilities Ticket](https://ivytechfacilities.bigwebapps.com/?org=21k4dm&dept=2y15y8) and attach them to it. The color printer does not print the colors clearly enough to tell the difference between the different tones used on the Guides. **Be sure to ask them to print them double-sided, collated, and stapled.**

##Tracking Transactions in RefAnalytics
Every time someone asks a question, it needs to be recorded.  We keep track of our questions using RefAnalytics, which tracks the date, time, what type of question, etc.  This information helps us in scheduling staff and in making sure we have the answers to the most frequently asked questions.  Once you log in to your computer, you should probably keep RefAnalytics open all day for ease of use.
- To access RefAnalytics, go to http://ivytech.libanswers.com/record.php.  
- Sign in using your username and password given to you by the Technology Librarian.  This will take you to the homepage for RefAnalytics.  
- Using the orange toolbar at the top, click on the arrow by Ref.Analytics, then Add Transaction.
- Type the question in the Question box--doesn't need to be correct grammar, or the complete question, just an approximation.
- The Date and Time stamp are already set to record when you submit, so if you answered a question a few hours ago and are just remembering to record it, you can edit the date/time stamp to reflect the more correct time.  It is not necessary.
- Also, the person signed in will be the person recorded as answering the question.  Some librarians may ask assistants to record their transactions, in which case you can select the correct person in the Answered by box.
- All of the boxes have a multiple choice which needs to be selected.
 - **Region 8** 
 - **Lawrence Campus**
 - **Type of Question** is related to exactly what it says.
    - Only librarians use the **Consultation Level**; this is for long reference questions that utilize more than one resource, usually for more than one aspect of the question,
    - **Direction/General** is for any simple questions, such as where is the registrar's office, or where is Panera, or do you have a pen?
    - **Reference Level 1** is a simple reference question, answered by a librarian.  Such as I need a book for this topic, or which database would I use for this?  Usually less time than Level 2.
    - **Reference Level 2** is the next level of reference question, answered by a librarian.  This is the level between level 1 and a consultation, so it takes a little longer and is a bit more complex, but not as complex as a consultation.
    - **Technical-Computer** is just what it says.  If someone needs help with email, Word, printing, or a Citation question, this is where it would be recorded.
 - **How was it asked** is self-explanatory, except for SMS.  This is a text-based question.
 - Be sure to record an approximate **Duration** for the question.
 - The **Patron Type** is also important; if we have staff and faculty asking questions as well as students, that needs to be recorded.
- Last but not least, click on **Submit**.  You should see a small black box in the center of the screen after you click Submit that will let you know if the question was submitted.

##Lost & Found
When items are left in the library, we keep them in the bottom right drawer of the circulation desk.  There is a clip board with a log that is to be filled out for every item left behind that we keep in the drawer and every item we take to Security.  
- Anything of value is taken immediately to Security, such as car keys, wallet, phone, etc. Hand them directly to a Security Guard and have that guard sign off on the Lost and Found log.
- Any article of clothing or something made of fabric cannot be taken to Security.  Depending on the item, we keep for at least a week if we have room for it (such as a coat).  Then it is disposed of.
- Anything to do with food cannot be taken to Security--no Tupperware, mugs, coffee thermos, etc.  We can keep if not dirty for a few days, then dispose of it.
- Drinks and food left behind in disposable containers are disposed of immediately.
- Items with names--flash drives, birth certificates, health records, etc. left on the copier--try to email the student to notify that we have it, then keep in the drawer with date emailed taped to it or on post it note.  Dispose of after 1 month.
