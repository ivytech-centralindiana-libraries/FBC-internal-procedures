#General Information
 
##Staff Communication
 
###In Case of Illness
 
###Inclement Weather
 As part of Ivy Tech Community College's ongoing effort to keep students, faculty and staff informed, the College has implemented an urgent information messaging system. [Ivy Tech Alert](https://www.ivytech.edu/alert/) allows students, faculty and staff to receive time-sensitive messages in the form of text messages and/or emails about inclement weather campus closings and other campus emergencies (lockdowns).  Go to the link provided to sign up.
 
###Google Calendar
The Lawrence Library has two calendars on the Google drive - for staff scheduling and for instruction.  The calendars can be accessed on the [calendar page of the library portal](https://sites.google.com/site/lawrencelibraryhomepage/calendars).  In order for you to view the more detailed information in the calendars, you must have a Google email account.  Each new employee gives their Google email account to the technology librarian, and they give them access to the calendars via their Google account.  

To access the staff calendar, go to Google.com, and click on the small nine-box grid in the upper right corner of the page.  Select Calendars from the drop down menu.  This will take you to the Lawrence calendars.  You can toggle back and forth from each one on the left-hand side section titled "My Calendars."  Along the top you can select to view a day, a week or a month.  

To access the information on the Bibliographic Instruction spreadsheet, which is created with the information faculty inputs from the Library Instruction Request Form (view the most recent form on the [Library Portal](https://sites.google.com/site/lawrencelibraryhomepage/library-links-1)), you must be "invited" by the technology librarian.  Each semester a new spreadsheet is created to hold the instruction information for that semester, and each semester you must be invited to view the new spreadsheet.  

To view the instruction spreadsheet, go to Google.com, and click on the small nine-box grid in the upper right corner of the page.  Select Drive from the drop down menu, then select "Shared with Me" from the menu on the left.  This will give you a list of Google docs you have been invited to view.  Select the spreadsheet you wish to see.  

##Desk Etiquette
- Always greet students with a hello and a smile when they first walk in the library.
- If you need to say “no”, explain why in a calm and respectful manner.
- Always treat the patrons with respect.
- If you are the only one on duty at the Circulation Desk and it is very busy (more than five patrons are waiting) you may ask the office manager or librarian on duty to help you if he/she is free. 
- If you are the only one on duty at the Circulation Desk and you want to leave the work area, either for break or washroom, please let the office manager and/or librarian on duty know. 
- If patrons complain about the library policy or procedure, refer them to the office manager.  If the issue cannot be resolved with the office manager, refer them to the assistant director in charge. 
- Staff will give patron with complaint the Assistant Director's card and email the assistant director with the history of the problem along with patron info.
- If a patron is rude to you, refer them to the office manager.  If the issue cannot be resolved with the office manager, refer them to the assistant director in charge, or excuse yourself and ask another person on duty to attend to the patron.
- When a patron is upset or demanding, take him/her to the librarian in charge at that time.

##Copying & Printing
Library workers may help students with copying by showing them which buttons to push, how to use the coin machine, or showing them the correct placement of items to be copies, but may not demonstrate or make copies for them.  This is due to the copyright laws and the Notice posted on the copier, which states "The Copyright Laws of the United States(Title 17,U.S. Code) Governs the Making of Photocopies or other Reproductions of Copyrighted Material.  Any Person Using this Equipment is Liable for any Infringement."
