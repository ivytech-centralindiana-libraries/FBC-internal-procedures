# Bibliographic Instruction

##Faculty Requests
Faculty will fill out a Library Instruction Request Form with the information needed for librarians to teach an information literacy class. (The current link to this form can be found on the [Library Portal](https://sites.google.com/site/lawrencelibraryhomepage/library-links-1).)  The Assistant Director will view each request and assign a librarian to each class request.  Once the librarian is notified, they will contact the instructor for more information.

## Teaching a One-Shot
Once faculty have filled out the request form for an instruction session, the Assistant Director will assign the class to a librarian.  The Assistant Director will put the assigned librarian's initials next to the class name on the Instruction Calendar and email to notify the librarian.  The librarian then can contact the instructor to let them know who is teaching the class and to ascertain exactly what the instructor wants covered during the class time.

- The librarian assigned creates lesson with IDEA and/or other resources that meets instructor's requirements
- Determine if instructor would like handouts for class; create handout or have assistant print enough for class
- Full time library assistant confirms the class date and time with instructors

##Roving and Pop-Ins
Each librarian is given an ipad to use during work.  The librarian can use the ipad to roam the halls during class change periods, lunch time, or anytime they notice a large number of students present.  The iPad can be used to give the librarian experience in assisting students with that technology.  Librarians may download free apps or pay for apps that they wish for personal use.

##Communicating with Faculty
Because of the difficulties of connecting to faculty in the community college setting, with many adjunct and online faculty never stepping foot in the library or the building where the library is located, librarians should consider alternate forms of contact. For example:

- Find faculty names for classes in liaison areas from the Class Schedule Search (ivytech.edu) for the current semester.
- Create a spreadsheet of your faculty or create a group in Outlook to send newsletter/emails to.
- Send an email introducing yourself with contact information to each faculty member at the beginning of each semester, or
- Email newsletters each semester or when there is an event/announcement of interest. These should promote library resources and services.
- Rove to the faculty offices that are accessible.
- Provide faculty learning sessions, such as Lunch n Learns, that would be interesting to faculty in order to network with participants.
- Attend any and all faculty workshops that are possible in order to become acquainted with faculty.
