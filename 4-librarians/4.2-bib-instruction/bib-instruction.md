## Teaching a One-Shot
Once faculty have filled out the request form for an instruction session, the Assistant Director will assign the class to a librarian.  The Assistant Director will put the assigned librarian's initials next to the class name on the Instruction Calendar and email to notify the librarian.  The librarian then can contact the instructor to let them know who is teaching the class and to ascertain exactly what the instructor wants covered during the class time.
