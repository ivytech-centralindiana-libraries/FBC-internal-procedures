##Reference and Information Service Defined
Reference service is the assistance given to customers in pursuit of information.

A reference question is defined as an informational contact, which involves the knowledge, recommendations, interpretation or instruction in the use of one of more information sources, by the member of the library staff. 

Reference includes providing help with the catalog and library computers, readerâ€™s advisory service, database and online research assistance, bibliographic assistance, interlibrary loan assistance, or referral services for more specialized or in-depth help elsewhere.

##Reference Interview
The reference interview is used to help define customer needs and to answer customer questions. Staff will begin reference transactions with verification of customer needs. The structured discussion that follows should clarify questions to be answered and the best way to provide the customer with information requested. The reference transaction will conclude with verification that the information need has been met.
