##Textbook Reserves
The library maintains many textbooks on reserve for short-term use in the library. Every attempt is made to have as many textbooks available as possible each semester for our face to face classes; however, for various reasons, we may not be able to acquire certain titles.  Each campus has the ability to purchase textbooks only for their own campus.

###Procedure

1. Contact bookstore for list of books for next semester.  Start asking for the list from the bookstore manager about 2 weeks before the semester ends, but you probably won’t receive it until the break.
2. Ask for a circulation report to be run on reserves and reserve storage for the previous year.
3. Once you receive the list, go through it and decide what to buy by looking at:
  - What books you already have
  - What books have changed
  - How many sections there are of each class that needs a book
4. Mark up the list with highlighters to highlight which books need to be purchased.
5. Create a spreadsheet of books we need including the course name, edition, year, and ISBN and price.
6. Add up the prices and compare what you need with what your budget will allow.
7. Ask circulation staff to look at the list and mark which ones they think will be requested most.
8. At the same time, have circulation staff pull the books that will be replaced and put them on carts in the circulation area.  These books will still be checked out, but when returned need to go back on the cart.
9. Determine which ones to buy from all of this information.  Sometimes you will have to buy less than what you need so you have to determine the MOST important ones by communicating to the circulation staff.
10. Get the P.O. number from Deb (office manager).
11. Take a cart, your spreadsheet, your PO and go shopping at Folletts. 
12. You need to tell Follett staff you are from the library and need to get into the blocked aisles to get your books. 
13. You will also need an experienced bookstore staff member to check you out they need to know how to do the PO.
14. Buy the books using the PO.  KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS.
15. When you get back from the bookstore, you need to put all information about the purchased book on  another spreadsheet.  This spreadsheet is on the J:drive in the Orders folder, under Main Order YEAR-YEAR.  The page is called Reserves.  This page is used by all three Region 8 campuses. Fill in all cells for each book you purchased. 
16. Put your total spent into the spreadsheet on the J:drive in the Finances folder, YEAR-YEAR TXTBK.  There is a page for FBC, NMC, and GRE.
17. Box books up and send to NMC Tech Services.  Put a list of them with the book in the box. 
18. Send Michele (Tech Services) an email letting her know they are on their way.
19. Have the books sent via Sam (intra institutional mail driver). Contact him to pick them up and take them directly to the NMC library and have Michele (Tech Services) send them back the same way.
20. When the books are done and come back, office staff needs to check them off of their spreadsheet which on the J:drive, in FBC Staff/Fairbanks Textbooks 2016.  The spreadsheet is called FBC spring/summer/fall YEAR.
21. The new books are shelved, and the old books are deleted. 
22. A list of the books that are deleted needs to be sent to Michele (Tech Services) to delete.  There is a shelf in the Lawrence office for the deletes to sit on until they are deleted.

##Midwest Library Service
Midwest Library Services is the service we use to order our books for Ivy Tech Libraries.  It is at http://midwestls.com/.  Bookmark it on your browser.  You will receive a username and password from them.

Once you login, to look for books you can select either Express Entry or Database Access, either on the light blue toolbar or in the listing on the page.  If you use the Database Access option, you are more likely to get results with an LC call number, so you know if it is in your liaison section.  You would also see a picture of the book cover.

You will have a default cart with your MLS username as it's name.  You can use the same cart over and over, because each time your send in an order it empties, unless you decide to Hold some books for later ordering.  The naming convention is for naming your Excel spreadsheets which are sent to Technical Services.

There is a duplicate check set up.  When you add a book to your cart and see the words ‘a possible duplication’ in red at the top, look to the left a line or two below them. You will  see OCLC identifiers for the different campuses. You will see all of the ones for the different regions. However, the ones you need to be aware of are the three libraries in Region 8.  We can’t get the identifiers to translate to the campus names because they are listed in the MARC record with the OCLC symbols. So you will want to look for these to see if there are duplicates in our region:

- XXWIN = NMC     
- XXHA = Greencastle     
- SSWIL = Lawrence

When you see the book price, it is the retail price, and not the actual net price we receive from MLS.  We have to wait until our books are invoiced to receive the net price of the books.

If you need any help or have questions call Terry or Steven at Midwest. They are very helpful and willing to do whatever is needed to help you with your orders. Midwest number is 800-325-8833. They do not have voice mail so if you get a busy signal, call back later.

## Ordering through Midwest Library Service

1. Use the year's PO (ask full-time Library Assistant for your new PO number). Do not fill in any box that says ‘Fund’. Midwest will do that when they separate the books according to the final price – below $35 or above $35.
2.Once you have your cart ready to order, with PO number, Quantity, and all Internal Comments added, go to the Pending Actions option on the light blue bar at the top of the page.
3. Click on Confirm Order Transactions.
4. This takes you to your cart.  Make sure all of the books you want to order have the radio button selected under Order.  If you don't want to order a particular book yet, you can Hold it.  If you decide not to order one, select the Delete radio button.
5. Go the the small box on the dark gold bar at the top of your title list where it says "To approve these transactions, place a check in the [box] and press Approve.  Press Approve.
6. Once you place your order you need to export the titles to an Excel spreadsheet and send it to Technical Services (Michele AND Andy) so they can enter it in the Master Order File (MOF). They will not have access to your accounts so you will have to give them this information.
7. We need to have a naming convention for our Excel spreadsheets/carts. They will be much easier to organize and find if they are all named the same way.  Initials; underscore; 2 digit date – XX.XX.XX  and then if you order more than one cart in a day’s time, use a,b,c  to indicate those carts. For example, for Jane Doe two carts in one day would look like this:  jd_03.17.16a; jd_03.17.16b.  Name your Excel spreadsheet/carts in this manner and then save them.
8. Save this Excel spreadsheet in the J drive under the new Midwest file. Each librarian will find a folder there for you to put your spreadsheet/cart reports in.  These reports need to have public access so that if something needs to be processed and Michele or Andy is not available, then others can go in a do the processing for you.
9. You will have to go into your account to find the final total prices for each cart you order. There is no way for you to know the discounted price until the invoice for your cart is loaded into your account. Once you have that you can record the final total for your cart in your CD spreadsheet page. It will be up to you to track your own spending. The invoices the NMC full-time Office Assistant (Dionna) will receive will not break up the orders in carts. They will list everything that is sent out each week and may be a combination of carts from different librarians’ orders.

## Checking Order Status
1. Hover over Account Activity on the light blue toolbar. 
2. Click on Order Status.
3. Put check marks in the check boxes for both Invoiced and Ordered books.
4. Make sure the dates selected are the correct dates for the orders you are looking for.
5. Search by Selector, and fill in your name as the selector.
6. Click Submit.
7. A list of your books ordered will come up.  Under Status, it will either say Ordered or Invoiced.  
8. If it is Invoiced, the Price will be the corrected net Price.  You will need to correct your Excel spreadsheet saved in your file on the J:drive, so you can keep track of your spending.  
9. Once you have the prices of each of the books on your order, be sure to update the Collection Development Budget spreadsheet in the Orders file on the J:drive.
