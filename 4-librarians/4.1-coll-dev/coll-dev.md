##Textbook Reserves
The library maintains many textbooks on reserve for short-term use in the library. Every attempt is made to have as many textbooks available as possible each semester for our face to face classes; however, for various reasons, we may not be able to acquire certain titles.  Each campus has the ability to purchase textbooks only for their own campus.

###Procedure

1. Contact bookstore for list of books for next semester.  Start asking for the list from the bookstore manager about 2 weeks before the semester ends, but you probably won’t receive it until the break.
2. Ask for a circulation report to be run on reserves and reserve storage for the previous year.
3. Once you receive the list, go through it and decide what to buy by looking at:
  - What books you already have
  - What books have changed
  - How many sections there are of each class that needs a book
4. Mark up the list with highlighters to highlight which books need to be purchased.
5. Create a spreadsheet of books we need including the course name, edition, year, and ISBN and price.
6. Add up the prices and compare what you need with what your budget will allow.
7. Ask circulation staff to look at the list and mark which ones they think will be requested most.
8. At the same time, have circulation staff pull the books that will be replaced and put them on carts in the circulation area.  These books will still be checked out, but when returned need to go back on the cart.
9. Determine which ones to buy from all of this information.  Sometimes you will have to buy less than what you need so you have to determine the MOST important ones by communicating to the circulation staff.
10. Get the P.O. number from Deb (office manager).
11. Take a cart, your spreadsheet, your PO and go shopping at Folletts. 
12. You need to tell Follett staff you are from the library and need to get into the blocked aisles to get your books. 
13. You will also need an experienced bookstore staff member to check you out they need to know how to do the PO.
14. Buy the books using the PO.  KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS.
15. When you get back from the bookstore, you need to put all information about the purchased book on  another spreadsheet.  This spreadsheet is on the J:drive in the Orders folder, under Main Order YEAR-YEAR.  The page is called Reserves.  This page is used by all three Region 8 campuses. Fill in all cells for each book you purchased. 
16. Put your total spent into the spreadsheet on the J:drive in the Finances folder, YEAR-YEAR TXTBK.  There is a page for FBC, NMC, and GRE.
17. Box books up and send to NMC Tech Services.  Put a list of them with the book in the box. 
18. Send Michele (Tech Services) an email letting her know they are on their way.
19. Have the books sent via Sam (intra institutional mail driver). Contact him to pick them up and take them directly to the NMC library and have Michele (Tech Services) send them back the same way.
20. When the books are done and come back, office staff needs to check them off of their spreadsheet which on the J:drive, in FBC Staff/Fairbanks Textbooks 2016.  The spreadsheet is called FBC spring/summer/fall YEAR.
21. The new books are shelved, and the old books are deleted. 
22. A list of the books that are deleted needs to be sent to Michele (Tech Services) to delete.  There is a shelf in the Lawrence office for the deletes to sit on until they are deleted.

##Midwest Library Service

###Basics
Midwest Library Services is the service we use to order our books for Ivy Tech Libraries.  It is at http://midwestls.com/.  Bookmark it on your browser.  You will receive a username and password from them.

Once you login, to look for books you can select either Express Entry or Database Access, either on the light blue toolbar or in the listing on the page.  If you use the Database Access option, you are more likely to get results with an LC call number, so you know if it is in your liaison section.  You would also see a picture of the book cover.

You will have a default cart with your MLS username as it's name.  You can use the same cart over and over, because each time your send in an order it empties, unless you decide to Hold some books for later ordering.  The naming convention is for naming your Excel spreadsheets which are sent to Technical Services.

There is a duplicate check set up.  When you add a book to your cart and see the words ‘a possible duplication’ in red at the top, look to the left a line or two below them. You will  see OCLC identifiers for the different campuses. You will see all of the ones for the different regions. However, the ones you need to be aware of are the three libraries in Region 8.  We can’t get the identifiers to translate to the campus names because they are listed in the MARC record with the OCLC symbols. So you will want to look for these to see if there are duplicates in our region:

- XXWIN = NMC     
- XXHA = Greencastle     
- SSWIL = Lawrence

When you see the book price, it is the retail price, and not the actual net price we receive from MLS.  We have to wait until our books are invoiced to receive the net price of the books.

If you need any help or have questions call Terry or Steven at Midwest. They are very helpful and willing to do whatever is needed to help you with your orders. Midwest number is 800-325-8833. They do not have voice mail so if you get a busy signal, call back later.

###Ordering
1. Use the year's PO (ask full-time Library Assistant for your new PO number). Do not fill in any box that says ‘Fund’. Midwest will do that when they separate the books according to the final price – below $35 or above $35.
2.Once you have your cart ready to order, with PO number, Quantity, and all Internal Comments added, go to the Pending Actions option on the light blue bar at the top of the page.
3. Click on Confirm Order Transactions.
4. This takes you to your cart.  Make sure all of the books you want to order have the radio button selected under Order.  If you don't want to order a particular book yet, you can Hold it.  If you decide not to order one, select the Delete radio button.
5. Go the the small box on the dark gold bar at the top of your title list where it says "To approve these transactions, place a check in the [box] and press Approve.  Press Approve.
6. Once you place your order you need to export the titles to an Excel spreadsheet and send it to Technical Services (Michele AND Andy) so they can enter it in the Master Order File (MOF). They will not have access to your accounts so you will have to give them this information.
7. We need to have a naming convention for our Excel spreadsheets/carts. They will be much easier to organize and find if they are all named the same way.  Initials; underscore; 2 digit date – XX.XX.XX  and then if you order more than one cart in a day’s time, use a,b,c  to indicate those carts. For example, for Jane Doe two carts in one day would look like this:  jd_03.17.16a; jd_03.17.16b.  Name your Excel spreadsheet/carts in this manner and then save them.
8. Save this Excel spreadsheet in the J drive under the new Midwest file. Each librarian will find a folder there for you to put your spreadsheet/cart reports in.  These reports need to have public access so that if something needs to be processed and Michele or Andy is not available, then others can go in a do the processing for you.
9. You will have to go into your account to find the final total prices for each cart you order. There is no way for you to know the discounted price until the invoice for your cart is loaded into your account. Once you have that you can record the final total for your cart in your CD spreadsheet page. It will be up to you to track your own spending. The invoices the NMC full-time Office Assistant (Dionna) will receive will not break up the orders in carts. They will list everything that is sent out each week and may be a combination of carts from different librarians’ orders.

###Checking Order Status
1. Hover over Account Activity on the light blue toolbar. 
2. Click on Order Status.
3. Put check marks in the check boxes for both Invoiced and Ordered books.
4. Make sure the dates selected are the correct dates for the orders you are looking for.
5. Search by Selector, and fill in your name as the selector.
6. Click Submit.
7. A list of your books ordered will come up.  Under Status, it will either say Ordered or Invoiced.  
8. If it is Invoiced, the Price will be the corrected net Price.  You will need to correct your Excel spreadsheet saved in your file on the J:drive, so you can keep track of your spending.  
9. Once you have the prices of each of the books on your order, be sure to update the Collection Development Budget spreadsheet in the Orders file on the J:drive.

###Setting up Selection Profiles
Selection Profiles can be set up by each librarian in Midwest Library Services.  These profiles, if set up to monitor LC classification, can be used to limit searches to only those within your LC range, and to receive once weekly new book reviews within your LC range.  Setting up Selection Profiles is not mandatory, it is simply a tool that will make collection development much easier.

To set up your Profile:

1. Once you login to MLS, look under the Collection Development tab or list on the homepage.
2. Click on Work with Selection Profiles
3. Make sure your name is showing on the page under Select a user...then click Create New Profile
4. Name your profile whatever you want.  If you are looking at several different LC classes or subjects, you might want to name the profile by the LC class, (for example, HM-HX) or by subject (Sociology).  Save your profile name.
5. Below that, under Database Selection, decide where you want to get your reviews from and how often.
6. Next, click on the Subject and Non-Subject Preferences tab, and select LC classification for use in limiting searches and receiving
new books reviews in your liaison areas.  (These instructions cover LC classification; if you want to set up selection profiles for other types of preferences, you can).
7. If you are liaison for an entire LC range, such as all "R's" then click the radio button under yes for that range.  If you are only liaison for part of an LC range, click on the link and then select smaller ranges (for example, RC-RJ) by selecting the radio button under Dup and Yes by each. Click Save these Selections.
8. Once you are done selecting LC ranges, use your breadcrumbs at the top to go back to your profile--it will show up in the breadcrumbs as the profile you named it.
9. Select the Notification Recipients tab, then Add Recipient.
10. This is where you add yourself as an email recipient from a drop down menu.  If you don't select email from the Method of Notification, you will not get any emails.  You may also choose to enable ordering from these notifications at this step.
11. SAVE
12. If you would like to set up multiple profiles, this is when you would use your breadcrumbs again to go back to Work with Selection Profiles and start over.

##Weeding
Weed using the guidelines in the [Collection Development Policy](http://library.ivytech.edu/c.php?g=453550&p=3098374).  When weeding, books that are to be deleted are scanned into a Temporary Deletes Status.  A report is run each week with all books with that status and sent to the Technical Services Department at NMC.  These barcodes are deleted, but the actual books are not sent.  

There are four options of what to do with weeded/deleted books.

1. Books with incorrect information in them that is dangerous, ie. older healthcare books, are shredded.
2. Books that are fiction or of general interest to the public can be placed in the Free Little Library.  There is a shelf in the Library Office for these books.
3. Books of personal interest to library employees can be saved for them to take home once deleted.  
4. Some books are donated to Better World Books through the Ivy Tech Foundation.  Below is list of what is acceptable to send. The Foundation receives a small amount of money for our donations. 
  - Books for the donation need to be boxed up and sent to the Technical Services Department at NMC.
  - Put labels on the boxes and send a “heads up” email to let them know when they are coming. 
  - Let Tech Services know how many boxes are on the way and that you have labeled them and inside the box, put a sheet that says “DELETES FOR BWBooks.”

##EBSCO eBook Purchases
**EBSCOhost Collection Manager User Guide adapted for Ivy Tech**
Lists are a set of titles that have been selected by a user and grouped under a single name. Lists provide you with a clean way to organize and submit orders for your selected titles. There are two types of lists in ECM; Ownership Lists and a PDA Lists.

**Ownership List**: This is a list of titles that you create with the intent to purchase. By submitting an order for an Ownership List, you are effectively purchasing all of the titles on that list.

**PDA List**:  Currently (March 2013) Ivy Tech has not established EBSCOhost-based PDA collections.  Lists at this time are Ownership Lists for title-by-title selections for purchase.

###Creating Lists

EBSCOhost Collection Manager allows you to create lists of titles and submit them to your institution's approver for purchase if you are a selector, or add them to your cart for purchase if you are an approver. 

*Note that currently (March 2013), using the username and password for this statewide ECM account grants an approver status to the user.  Lists are used in a selection process and then sent to a cart for purchase/order. To avoid confusion and establish a standard practice, Ownership List names should begin with the region name and then the date of list creation.  Additional information as to subject area or other category might also be included after the date.* Example of a list name:  **North Central – 3/13/2013--Nanotechnology**

####To create a list from the Home screen

From the My Lists drop-down in the top toolbar, select Create a new List, or click the New List button under My Lists on the right side of the screen.

Enter a Name for your list in the field provided and click the Create List button.

Your newly created list is displayed on the In Progress Lists screen. Click the hyperlinked list name to edit your list details, or begin searching for titles to add to your list by enter terms in the Find field and clicking Search.

####To create a list from the result list

Click the Add to List/PDA link to add a single title to a new list, or click Add Page to List/PDA to add all displayed titles.

Select the desired Access Model in the resulting pop-up and click the Add to List button.

Enter a Name for your list in the field provided and click the Create List button.

The title is added to your list and a window appears at the top of the screen displaying that the title has been added. You can remove the title from the list immediately by clicking Undo in the window.

View the details of your list by clicking View List Details.

###Editing Lists and Adding Titles to Lists

After you have created lists of titles, you can:  Add Titles to Lists, Edit Titles and Access Models, Edit List Settings.  After you create a list, you can continue to add titles to it before submitting it for approval.

####To add titles to lists

From the ECM result list, add individual titles to a list by clicking Add to List/PDA or click Add Page to List/PDA to add all items on the page.

Select the list to which you would like to add titles from the Select List drop-down menu and click Add to List.

The titles are added to your list and you are notified in a window below the My Lists drop-down menu. Click the Undo button to remove the added titles from the list.

###The List Lifecycle

As lists are created, purchased and edited in ECM, they will undergo a series of states. Below is a brief overview of the various states you can expect.  Note that at this time (March 2013) anyone using the current username and password for this statewide IVY Tech ECM has the Approver status.

- In Progress – The list has been created but not submitted for approval. At this stage, you can still add or remove titles from a list.
- Purchased – After you have completed the checkout process, all of the lists in your Shopping Cart will enter a Purchased state.
- Active (PDA Only) – When a PDA List is purchased; the list goes into an Active state. This means that the title’s on that list will become available for your patrons to trigger. Note: Immediately after purchasing a PDA list, the list may be Active but the titles will not become accessible until a few hours after the checkout process was completed.
- Deactivated (PDA Only) – A PDA List can be deactivated by any Approver at an institution. Once a PDA list is deactivated, the titles on the list are hidden to your patrons (please allow some time for our system to make the titles inaccessible).
- Suspended (PDA Only) – ECM puts PDA Lists into a Suspended state when they have exhausted their allocated funds. Like deactivated lists, titles in lists that are Suspended will no longer be visible to your patrons.

###Ordering

After a list has been approved and the check out process has been completed, the ball is in our court to get the content to you. Here is a quick breakdown of what happens after you place your order in ECM:

1. Order Fulfillment – Expect to have all of your content accessible a few hours after the check out process has been completed. Once your items are fulfilled, we will send you a fulfillment receipt outlining the details of your purchase. You will receive your fulfillment receipt before you are able to access the content. Typically titles will be available 2 hours after you receive your fulfillment receipt. The fulfillment receipt is not your invoice; invoices will be sent out separately. Note: You will not receive a fulfillment receipt for PDA list orders since no titles were actually purchased.
2. MARC Delivery – As part of our ordering process, we make sure your receive all of the MARC records for each title you purchase. The MARC records are delivered via OCLC within one business week of your order. You will receive an email notification with instructions on how to download your MARC records from OCLC once your records have been created.
3. Invoicing – A couple of weeks after your order has been fulfilled we will send you an invoice for your order.

####Choosing an Access Model

ECM presents you with 3 different access models, giving you greater flexibility in selecting titles that will meet the needs of your target audience. But how do you know which access model is right for you? Take a look at our access model definitions and recommendations to assist you in your purchasing decision:

- 1U – This is the most basic model and allows 1 patron at a time to access the title. If you are not sure whether a title will generate a lot of use or if you know that a title will not be used a lot, we recommend the 1U model to get you started.
- 3U – Unlike our 1U model, our 3U model allows 3 patrons to simultaneously access a copy of the book. If you expect moderate use of a title or if there is an existing 1U title with a lot of holds or turnaways, you should consider purchasing or upgrading to the 3U model.
- UU – Our top of the line access model, UU access allows an unlimited number of patrons to simultaneously access the title. We recommend purchasing this title for books that you expect to be really popular.

####Account Settings 

EBSCOhost Collection Manager (ECM) includes a full set of account settings that allow selectors and approvers to customize ECM functionality.

To access the ECM settings menu, hold your pointer over your account name in the upper-right corner of the screen and click Account Settings in the resulting drop-down menu.

**Note**: You must click the Save Settings button to save any changes you make before navigating away from the settings menu.
