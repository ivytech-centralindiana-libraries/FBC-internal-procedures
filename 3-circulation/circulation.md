##Fines & Fees

**10% payment plan** – have to file fine appeal first.  No “stop gap” part...Pay 10% then file appeal. 

1. Submit fine appeal.
2. Could approve or reduce or waive fine altogether or offer 10% payment plan.
3. Put notes on record in popups that they have accepted 10% plan, initial and date, explained fine policy, newest notes on top.
4. 10% allows student to c/o for one week.  They are responsible for showing receipt to show payment (wouldn’t this be in Voyager record?)

{Fines paid at Bursar.  If student pays a fine at the Bursar and shows receipt at library, library staff posts amount on Voyager (Bursar has already cleared Banner), paid with credit card, in description field, notes “paid at Bursar” and dates and initials of library staff.}

{Veteran’s Day fines forgiven.  The week of Veteran’s Day, if vet shows military ID we forgive all fines for overdue, fines for lost item replacement do not apply. 

Food for fines – the last 4 weeks of the semester, we forgive any overdue fines when students bring in non-perishable items with valid expiration date for the Bear Necessities pantry.  Fines for lost item replacement do not apply. 

Technically, no limit to how much food they can bring to pay off overdue fine.  1 can--$1; 1 package = $1

When a student pays a fine at the Bursar’s, they send an email to me and Deb.  Deb normally goes into voyager, adjusts the record to reflect the payment, sometimes they don’t pay the whole amount so you have to be careful…payment method is “credit card” rather than cash…there’s no “paid at bursar’s option.”

Committee members: Paula Hearn & Erica McFarland

####Process

1. Patron disputes library fine at counter; librarian reviews fine with patron.
2. Patron submits appeal form to committee.
3. Committee meets on a weekly basis in person or by phone to review appeals.  If needed, a member may contact patron for additional information.
4. Committee’s first email response will be sent to student within 7-10 business days.  This first response may be a request for additional information or final decision of the committee.  The director and all committee members will be blind copied on all email communications. 
  * NOTE: Email has to be sent from a personal email account.  If a committee member has had previous communication with a student about the appeal, that member should not send the committee’s response.
5. Documentation of appeal process is noted throughout on the patron’s Voyager record. A new note should be created for each fine appeal.  Within that note, the following steps should be listed with date completed, staff initials, and outcome of that step:  appeal form received date, written appeal outcome.  Additional notes should be added as necessary to explain special circumstances.

## Lost Items

When student pays for lost book:

1. Discharge book from Voyager record

3. She will also send on to Assistant Director of that library in case they want to re-order
4. She will also remove the hold from Banner

## Other

[Deletes – Need to work on.  Can we delete sooner than two years?  After two years, delete overdue fines but don’t delete fines for lost books or textbooks.]

For REF c/o – train support staff to offer the free scan option….it lowers the risk of REF title being lost/damaged.
