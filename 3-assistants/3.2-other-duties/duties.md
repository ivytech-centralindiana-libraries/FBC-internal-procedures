#Other Duties & Responsibilities

##Displays
Displays are routinely changed each month.  Librarians do the planning for each display, then may delegate putting it together to the assistants.  This is one of the special projects that can be assigned.  

Background paper for the displays are found in the tall black storage cabinet.  Borders for the displays are found in the yellow and purple boxes on top of the storage cabinets.  

When changing displays out each month, make sure the glass shelves are dusted and the glass doors are clean.

Before any books can be put on the display shelves, they must be put On Display in Voyager.  This is to ensure that if a student is looking for a book that is not on the shelf, if it is On Display, there is another place to look for it. (See Putting Books on Display).

##Office Supplies
The full-time Library Assistant does periodical inventory of supplies to determine if any are needed.  Ivy Markets training provided by Ivy Tech is necessary to order items.  If you use something and it is in short supply, please notify the full time Library Assistant via email--especially if it is copier/printer toner.

##Shelving Books
1. It is extremely important that books are shelved and kept in their correct order. 
  - It is very frustrating when an item isn’t where it is supposed to be.
  - If you have questions about where to shelve a particular item, ask your supervisor or other staff member; we will be glad to help.
2. Book care:
  - Always handle books with care; avoid dropping as much as possible.
    - Books and their bindings are expensive
  - Books should not be shelved on their front edges; their weight loosens covers.
    - However, there will be shelving areas where this can’t be avoided
3. Put books in order on cart according to type (reference, circulating) and call number before shelving.
4. When you are shelving, please put any other books that you notice out of place back where they belong.

##Shelf Reading
Shelf Reading can be done if there are other staff members in the Library to watch the Front Desk and no other projects or tasks to do. It can also be done if a librarian assigns a particular area to be completed by an assistant because of weeding needing to be done or if the area is particularly messy.

The assistant simply starts reading the call numbers from one end of the shelving unit to the other to make sure that all of the books are in correct call number order.  (See [Putting Call Numbers in Shelf Order](http://library.ivytech.edu/c.php?g=416463&p=2837874#s-lg-box-wrapper-11785989)).  When shelf reading, make sure the books on a shelf line up neatly and that there is a book at the end of the shelf face-out for display if there is a book stand there.
