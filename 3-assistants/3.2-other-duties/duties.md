##Displays
Displays are routinely changed each month.  Librarians do the planning for each display, then may delegate putting it together to the assistants.  This is one of the special projects that can be assigned.  

Background paper for the displays are found in the tall black storage cabinet.  Borders for the displays are found in the yellow and purple boxes on top of the storage cabinets.  

For a list of posters that can be used for displays, see [FBC Posters](http://library.ivytech.edu/c.php?g=416463&p=3316457).

When changing displays out each month, make sure the glass shelves are dusted and the glass doors are clean.

Before any books can be put on the display shelves, they must be put On Display in Voyager.  This is to ensure that if a student is looking for a book that is not on the shelf, if it is "On Display," there is another place to look for it. 

- To begin the process of putting the books on display, scan all books into a Notepad file and name the file by display title and month/year, i.e. Poetry April2016. Creating the Notepad file ensures that when all books in the file are taking out of the "On Display" status, even books that are checked out will have the status removed.
- Save the file under the Book Displays folder on the J:Drive. Make sure to process the file in the Pick and Scan function on Voyager when putting the books on and off display. (See [Changing Temporary Location](http://library.ivytech.edu/c.php?g=416463&p=3249759#s-lg-box-wrapper-11825872)).
- Save the file in the Book Displays folder on the `J:Drive/FBC Staff/FBC General`.
- Make sure to process the file in the Pick and Scan function on Voyager when putting the books on and off display. (For instructions to place one book at a time, see Changing Temporary Location).
  - Click the `Functions` tab at the top left of the screen
  - Select `Pick and Scan…`
  - Under `Locations` in the top-left of the screen you’ll notice dropdown lists for `Permanent` and `Temporary`.
  - To change `Temporary` locations, select the dropdown arrow to choose `Temporary` location and select `Fairbanks Center On Dis`.
  - Then click on the `Records To Change` tab in the top-middle of your screen.
  - Underneath `What to do` in the top-right corner of your screen, select `Update Database`.
  - Directly below that is the `File` box; click on the 3 dots at the end of that box.  This will open a dialog box for you to find and select the saved Notepad txt file.
  - Select the correct file.
  - Click on `Process File`.  You should see the large screen flash with all the records in the file processing.
  - Then click Close in the bottom-right of the screen.

##Library Guides for Assistants

### Initial Set Up
As a new employee, the Web Services Librarian should set up a Springshare LibApps accont for you. This account login acts as the gateway for many different tools under the LibApps system, and one of those tools is LibGuides. It is an Ivy Tech Libraries policy that we refer to LibGuides as Library Guides.

### Getting to Know LibGuides
Once you have an account in LibApps, watch ["Getting to Know LibGuides,"](http://support.springshare.com/libguides/training/basics/recording#s-lg-box-5719891) a tutorial created by Springshare. This video is a beginner's guide to the skills that assistants need to know to work in the LibGuides platform.

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/154096135" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Check in with Librarian
Upon completion of the tutorial, the assistant should check in with the Web Services Librarian. The Web Services Librarian will check the assistant's knowledge and understanding of the following LibGuide tasks:

1. Logg in to LibApps
2. Navigate to LibGuides
3. Select a guide to edit
4. Create a new page
5. Create a box with links
6. Create a box with books from catalogue
7. Create a box with text and an image
8. Reuse an exisitng box
9. Change a box layout
10. Reorder pages
11. Reorder boxes

### Ongoing Duties
Assistants will edit guides as needed. Librarians will assign guides for assistants to edit. If an assistant cannot access the guide assigned to them, the assistant should ask the librarian for editing permissions in LibGuides. 

### Additional Help
If there is ever a question on how to perform a task within LibGuides (or any other LibApps tool), please check the [Springshare Support & Documentation](http://support.springshare.com/libguides). If the answer cannot be found in the Springshare Support documentation, forward your question to the Web Services Librarian.


##Shelving Books
1. It is extremely important that books are shelved and kept in their correct order. 
  - It is very frustrating when an item isn’t where it is supposed to be.
  - If you have questions about where to shelve a particular item, ask your supervisor or other staff member; we will be glad to help.
2. Book care:
  - Always handle books with care; avoid dropping as much as possible.
    - Books and their bindings are expensive
  - Books should not be shelved on their front edges; their weight loosens covers.
    - However, there will be shelving areas where this can’t be avoided
3. Put books in order on cart according to type (reference, circulating) and call number before shelving.
4. When you are shelving, please put any other books that you notice out of place back where they belong. 

**To learn more about Library of Congress Classification system and Call Numbers, see [Understanding Call Numbers](http://library.ivytech.edu/c.php?g=416463&p=2837874).**

##Shelf Reading
Shelf Reading can be done if there are other staff members in the Library to watch the Front Desk and no other projects or tasks to do. It can also be done if a librarian assigns a particular area to be completed by an assistant because of weeding needing to be done or if the area is particularly messy.

The assistant simply starts reading the call numbers from one end of the shelving unit to the other to make sure that all of the books are in correct call number order.  (See [Putting Call Numbers in Shelf Order](http://library.ivytech.edu/c.php?g=416463&p=2837874#s-lg-box-wrapper-11785989)).  When shelf reading, make sure the books on a shelf line up neatly and that there is a book at the end of the shelf face-out for display if there is a book stand there.

##Double Logins
If a student or community user is logged in to more than one computer at a time, send a message via NetControl that states "No double logins allowed. Please log off one computer."  After allowing a few minutes for student to respond, shut one of the computers down using NetControl.

##Net Control 2 Pro
###Introduction to Net Control:

1. Begin by clicking the start button and entering Net Control 2 in the search bar.
2. Click on the program to open it.​
3. Double click F124-G to view the library computers.  Double click F126-G to view the classroom computers.
4. Wait for the computer stations to load.

###How to send messages on Net Control:

1. Once the computer stations have completely loaded click on Messaging in the top middle of the screen.
2. Then click Messages, which is located to the left of the Chat option.
3. On the right of the screen there will now be a section that says “Text of Message” with a blank box and below that are background options. Next to the blank box there is a dropdown arrow. Click the arrow and preset messages will display on the screen.
4. Select the message you want all users to see on their screen.
  - Computers restart five minutes before the library closes. Closing messages are sent thirty minutes prior, fifteen minutes prior, ten minutes prior, and one minute prior to the computers restarting.
  - If the library closes at 5 PM send the message, “Library closes at 5pm. Computers will shut down at 4:55 pm. Please save your work” at 4:30, 4:45, and 4:50. At 4:54 PM send a different message that reads, “Final Reminder! Computers will shut down in 1 minute. Please save work.” Then restart the computers. To see how to restart computers view How to Restart Computers Below.
5. Then click anywhere in the empty white space on the left side of the screen and press CTRL + A to select all of the stations.
6. Once all computers have been selected you may hit the send button.
7. The message should have broadcasted successfully. If you feel unsure that the message was sent correctly, sometimes you can see that the message was sent because it still remains on computers that had recent activity. You can also watch a computer that is in view of the circulation desk as the message pops up on the screen.
