##Tech Services Issues

###When a book/item needs attention

If you find a book or item that has an issue such as call number change, changing permanent location, fixing spine label or any other label, etc., place the item on the full-time Library Assistant's desk and send an email to her explaining the issue. 

###Who gets notified?

The full-time Library Assistant forwards the email to the appropriate person, and always cc’s Linda and Meg.  If a call number needs to change, that is Donna.  Once Donna okay’s the call number change, then it goes to Michele to change the record. Michele needs to be notified via email of all changes except a change in location—either temporary or permanent.  In that case, only Deb, Linda, and Meg need to be notified.

###Where does it go from there?

The item then goes on the Tech Services Attention shelf on the tall black bookcase in the Library Office if it can be fixed in-house.  If it goes to the Downtown Tech Services Office (Michele) it goes in a green bag with a copy of the email printed out and included in or around it.

###FBC Tech Service Issues Spreadsheet

If the item needs to be fixed/changed by Michele/Tech Services in any way, Deb enters the necessary information into the spreadsheet located at J:/FBC Staff/Tech Services/FBC Tech Service Issues (see link below).  The person who sends the information and/or item Downtown initials the spreadsheet with the date sent; the person who checks the completed item and determines if it is correct or not initials and dates it as well.

###Where is it done?

- Meg can change temporary and permanent location of an item.  Michele does not need to be notified of this.
- Call number changes or fixes—Michele does Downtown; notify via email
- Spine labels, stickers or other physical changes can be done here.  Michele will already be notified if a spine label needs to change because of call number change; Meg will change the actual item here.
- If a paperback book needs a new cover, the item needs to go to the Downtown Tech Services office.
