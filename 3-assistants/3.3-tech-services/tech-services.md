##Tech Services Issues

###When a book/item needs attention

If you find a book or item that has an issue, determine if a librarian needs to look at the item before you do anything.  A librarian should be notified if the issue is something such as call number change or changing permanent location. If the issue is cosmetic, such as fixing a spine label or any other label, etc., a librarian does not need to be notified.  

Once it is determined that the item needs attention, place the item on the Full-time Library Assistant's desk with a Tech Services slip in it filled out with the appropriate information about the item.  These slips are located in an acrylic stand on the Tech Services Attention shelf of the black bookcase in the Library Office.  You can then send an email to the full-time Library Assistant explaining the issue if she is not present. 

###Who gets notified?

If the issue is a change in the Voyager record, the full-time Library Assistant forwards the email (or creates one if one is not sent to her) to the appropriate person in the Tech Services Department downtown.  The Full-Time Tech Services staff member needs to be notified via email of all **changes** except a change in temporary location.  Permanent location changes are either forwarded on to the Tech Services Staff downtown or handled by trained staff at Lawrence at the discretion of the Full-Time Library Assistant and/or Full-Time Librarian. (see [Location Changes](http://library.ivytech.edu/c.php?g=416463&p=3249759#s-lg-box-wrapper-13868743)).

###Where does it go from there?

If it can be fixed in-house, the item then goes on the Tech Services Attention shelf on the tall black bookcase in the Library Office. If it cannot be fixed in-house and it goes to the Downtown Tech Services Office, it goes in a green bag with a copy of the email sent to the Tech Services staff printed out and included in or around it and the Tech Services slip in it, as well.

###Where is it done?

- Any assistant can change temporary location and permanent location can be changed by trained staff at Lawrence at the discretion of the Full-Time Library Assistant and/or Full-Time Librarian.  Full-Time Tech Services Staff does not need to be notified of this.
- Call number changes or fixes in Voyager—Full-Time Tech Services Staff does Downtown; notify via email
- Spine labels, stickers or other physical changes can be done here.  Full-Time Tech Services Staff will already be notified if a spine label needs to change because of call number change; an assistant will change the actual item here.
- If a paperback book needs a new cover, the item needs to go to the Downtown Tech Services office.

##Weeding Items for the Assistant
1. Once Librarians have decided on books to delete they will bring them to you on a cart. Open a notepad and scan all the books’ barcodes into the document.

2. Save the document in an easily accessible folder.
3. Open Voyager and select Item.

7. A box with pop up called Outstanding Fines for this Item.
  ![Screenshot of circled item icon](http://s3.amazonaws.com/libapps/accounts/41940/images/weeding5.jpg)
  - If there are no names then there are no fines to resolve and thus you can proceed to the next barcode.
  - If there are fines on the item resolve them as current policy permits. 2015’s policy states to forgive a fine under $5.00 but on occasion we have been known to forgive fines under $10.00. See librarians and full-time assistant. If the fine is larger than policy stipulates it needs to be transferred to a dummy barcode. See [Dummy Barcode Procedure](http://library.ivytech.edu/c.php?g=416463&p=3041357#s-lg-box-wrapper-13378352).
8. After all barcodes have been cleared of fines proceed to step 9.
9. Select Pick and Scan from the Function tab.

  ![Screenshot of circled item icon](http://s3.amazonaws.com/libapps/accounts/41940/images/weeding12.jpg)
  - If you try and save the file in the deletes 06.03.16 format it will not save. You have to save it as 060316 and then rename the file once you have finished.
19. You can exit Pick and Scan once the file is saved.
20. Scan a few of book barcodes from the beginning, middle, and end of the list to ensure the item locations were successfully updated to Temporary Deletes.
21. After the books have been marked as Temporary Deletes and there is record of the books deleted, sort the books for their intended destinations.
  - Some books need to be shredded.
    - Books to be shredded are books that include information that could be false, harmful, or dangerous such as medical books, legal books, etc. Books that contain points of reference near the back such as organizations, foundations, etc. should also be shredded.
    - To shred books simply take them to the large recycle bins and tear the front cover off the book and throw them in the bin.
  - Some books can be sent to the Foundation.
    - The list of what the Foundation will and will not accept is at the bottom of this procedure.
    - You would select the books suitable for delivery, place the books in a box, insert a paper that says “Foundation Books” on top of the books, close the lid, and tape the address with packing tape to the top of the box. It will be sent to Michele Shaw and the address headers can be found in the black drawer by the window in Deb’s office. You would then use packing tape to tape the box closed and deliver it to the Mailroom. As a last step email Michele with a brief message stating the number of boxes sent and that they are for the foundation.
- Some books can be used for the little free library.
    -Use your own discretion for these books.
    - Once you’ve selected which books would best serve the Little Free Library take a sharpie and mark out the barcode, Ivy Tech Logos (check the inside covers, the outside of the pages, etc.), and Spine Label. Place them on the shelf in Deb’s office for the LFL.
